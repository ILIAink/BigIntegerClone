## Purpose

- This project recreates the functionality of Java's BigInteger class and behaves similarly. Since primitive types like `int` or `long` have size limits (2147483647 and 2^63, respectively), this class allows users to enter and perform arithmetic operations on numbers exceeding these limits. Users can input large numbers as `Strings` and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease..

## Why it's cool

- During this project, my objective was to train a computer to perform basic arithmetic operations, which required a methodology similar to teaching a third-grader. While it may seem straightforward in foresight, the process turned out to be rather intricate and demanding **(almost 1000 lines of code)**. Precision was crucial, and I had to consider numerous factors to ensure accuracy, particularly with division.
